<h3 id = "first">Iliyas Hanshaim's journey to love</h3>
<p>When I met her, it was completely unexpected. I was exiting a marriage, focused on health, and parenting my little heart out. At first, it was all business as I was introduced to her as a client. As time went on, we got along really well and spent the majority of our days talking. I never looked at it as more than an authentic human connection. The more time, the more talking, the more shared experiences, and the closer we got. A few months in, we were full-fledged friends and not the superficial kind. We had all the ingredients to be best friends or possibly even more.</p>
<p>It wasn't apparent at first because we were both in a place in our current relationships where we were leaving but not all the way done yet. Neither of us were even in the place to want more or give more. When our current relationships ended, we continued on our path of closeness. We aligned socially, and spiritually, and we both had things to teach the other. I don't think either of us realized anything else was going on that first year. Our relationship was innocent and built on pure friendship.</p>
